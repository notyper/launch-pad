# launch-pad
Launch pad project for The Odin Project

In this project, I will create a start page for a fictitious business that I do not actually have. 

The purpose of this project is to gain experience and knowledge of the use of CSS Flexbox.  Other CSS concepts are also employed in the creation of the page design.

Through various iterations, this became a page about cookies.
